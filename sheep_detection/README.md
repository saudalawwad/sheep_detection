# Sheep detection with interface and graph

In this project I used a model that detects and count each sheep in each frame then display it in a graph, I used yolo3 and darknet for the model also used OpenCV for the pre-processing and Tkinter for the interface, you can download the weight from here https://pjreddie.com/darknet/yolo/ and paste it in the code.
