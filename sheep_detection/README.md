# Sheep detection with interface and graph

In this project I used model that detect and count each sheep in each frame then display it in a grap, I used yolo3 and darknet for the model also I used openCV for the pre proccesing and tkinter for the interface, you can download the weight from here https://pjreddie.com/darknet/yolo/ and paste it in the code.
